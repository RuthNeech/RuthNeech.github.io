      <h3>I strongly believe that everyone has the capacity to build their resilience and everyone will benefit from doing so.</h3>
      <p>Never have I experienced greater resilience, than the four years I was a Child Protection Caseworker for the NSW Government. It was my first job after university, where I had studied psychology and while my interest in people was considerable, my first hand experience of struggle and social diversity was limited.</p>
      <p>I admired the strength, determination for happiness and the proactive outlook I saw in the families I worked with and in my colleagues. I also recognised the growth and development in myself over those years and the valuable beliefs and behaviours that would make me stronger in my future career.</p>
      <div style="display:none">
        <p>During my postgraduate studies, while completing a Masters in Art Therapy, I had the opportunity to work with a range of clients who lived with disabilities. Yet again, my perspective of resilience was shaped by people who were not enduring their life challenges but rather, they found meaning from their experiences and were fundamentally made stronger.</p>
        <p>I’ve now been working in people centred roles for over 12 years, in a range of industries and I strongly believe that everyone has the capacity to build their resilience and everyone will benefit from doing so.</p>
        <p>As the People & Culture Manager for Bilue, a mobile and emerging technology company, I am directing my experience of resilience to address the unique challenges faced by people working in the technology industry.</p>

          <p>When I joined Bilue as our dedicated People & Culture Manager, I wasn’t entirely sure what was in store for me. I excitedly told my nearest and dearest about the appointment and they responded ‘ahhh…HR’. I was quick to learn that it is so much more than this.</p>
